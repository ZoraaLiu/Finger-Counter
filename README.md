# Finger-Counter
This project showcases a robust real-time finger detection algorithm, capable of accurately estimating the number of fingers being raised using computer vision techniques. The algorithm leverages the power of OpenCV and NumPy libraries to process live camera input and provide instant feedback on finger count.
